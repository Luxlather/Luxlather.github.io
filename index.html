        <p>
            One year back I was learning how to code and develop ROBLOX games! Seeing all of the ROBLOX exploits on Youtube made me wonder whether I should use my scripting for that. A year after that I decided to try.<br><br>

            Me and my friend made a Roblox Script Hub called KongerHub. It was really popular, we hit 800 members in 2 months. But then the server got raided so I made a new server. That made me wanna quit making scripts, so I did, but only because this type of scripting was meant to harm others. I'll use my scripting for something better.<br><br>
            
            Our discord server will remain up and active for users who want to have a "chill spot" over a product server. Thank you all for using our script. It was a pleasure helping you guys.<br><br>
            
            We'll see you around!<br>
