        <p>
            One year back I was learning how to code and develop ROBLOX games! Seeing all of the ROBLOX exploits on Youtube made me wonder whether I should use my scripting for that. A year after that I decided to try.<br><br>

            Me and my friend made a Roblox Script Hub called KongerHub. It was really popular, we hit 800 members in 2 months. But then the server got raided so I made a new server. That made me wanna quit making scripts, so I did, but only because this type of scripting was meant to harm others. I'll use my scripting for something better.<br><br>
            
            Our discord has been closed due to this. Thank you all for using our script and supporting us throughout the way of our scripting journey. I can speak on behalf of my entire team that we will never forget how awesome it was to maintain and develop KongerHub for you guys.
